Nowted is a visually striking and highly functional note-taking app with a variety of features and tools to help users organize, edit, and access their notes. The app has a clean and modern design, with a three-column layout that allows users to easily navigate and access their notes. The first column is a sidebar that contains a list of folders, recent opened files, a search function, and other features. The second column is a list of the files in the opened folder, and the third column is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor that allows users to edit and format their notes. It is a key part of the user's overall note-taking experience, and can be used to organize and access notes in a variety of ways.
